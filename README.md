# GrindCPU v0.5
A microcontroller-controlled electric conical burr grinder.

## Abstract

The Baratza Virtuoso has been my trusty coffee grinder for a few years now, but has only a wind-up timer and pulse button. In lieu of the pulse button, I have implemented an Arduino with an OLED display to enhance it's features. A 5V relay replaced the pulse button for the internals.

## Features

Currently, the grinder has the following modes:
  1. Timed grind
  2. Toggle grinder on/off
  3. Pulse grind

## Future Improvements/Versions
* 1.0
  * 3D printed case
  * ON/OFF switch for display/Arduino
* 1.5
  * Internal 12v power supply for the Arduino
  * Autopurge to catch "popcorning" beans?
* 2.0
  * Hack into the speed control for the motor using a digital potentiometer.
